    <h1>To My Dearest Tassu üíå</h1>
    <h3>Let‚Äôs talk about the real world now‚Ä¶</h3>

    <div class="content">
      <pre>
Aapko pata hai duniya mein har cheez ki keemat paise se lagayi jaati hai.
So how can we compete here?

üåç <span class="section-title">The Hidden System</span>
1. The world is ruled by a new world order ‚Äî handled by Illuminati groups.
   Their biggest mission is to take a person‚Äôs willpower away,
   break them from inside, disconnect them from their dreams, vision, and potential.

2. They targeted the youth.
   How? By corrupting the syllabus, flooding the content with distractions like po**, nudity, 
   over-sexualization, and unnecessary competition.
   They trap us into a loop: padhayi ‚Üí job ‚Üí biwi ‚Üí bache ‚Üí savings ‚Üí retirement.

3. Attraction between genders? 
   It is scientifically controlled by hormones like dopamine and oxytocin ‚Äî 
   which are exploited at youth.

4. Depression is at its peak.
   Youth is drowning in addiction, distractions, and disconnection from Allah.

‚òùÔ∏è <span class="section-title">The Reality Check</span>
You know what now a days people study till graduation still they get the job of 10k 25k 50k enough
but those who don't even saw the school are ones who actually making crores in a single month 
but how it possible 
jabke hamko kaha gya tha ke padhoge likhoge to banoge nawaab 

yes it's true padhayi zaruri hai but today's education is just a trash after 4 years of enginerring still the engineer can't 
even make a application even not a single website 
so why he deserve the money 
that's the point 
there is nothing like after graduation we will get a job 

job is a thing that is hiring a person for a work 
so if i hire a person for 10k per month definetily i will take work of 20k from him
but if a person not even have a skill how can he work on the tasks projects etc...

That means skills matter more than just degree 
degree certificate is a gate pass but the exection is based on degree 

and once you understand how the real world problems are solved then definetily you will make a solution for a actual problem
and the world will pay you for that 
not in hundred not in thousand but in crores 
and that's true 

the major thing in our society is they think having a much money is also a fitnah or from the haram source
that's the mindset that the illuminati [the group of dajjal] are being plant in our mind and they are being successfull in large term too

But let me answer this 
Today muslims are being bullied,killed etc 
Just because we are not in power
Power in this duniya refer to money 
So if we want to stop these we need to be strong by power that will actually come when you have enough money 
To help individuals, to take steps, to take action, to have the courage to speak 
So that means money have to be earned it a largest amount and take responsibilities of the needy ones, family, relatives and the Ummah

üí° <span class="section-title">The Business Mindset</span>
let's talk how to think big, execute and win 

See there is some common things in the world with large number of audience 

Category        	Global Size (2024)	      India (2024) Brief Notes

Food Retail	        $12.6 trillion	              65% of Indian retail (‚Çπ82T total), strong growth
Apparel / Clothing	$1.79 trillion                ~3% growth; part of rising non-food spending share
Education        	$7.6 trillion                 USD‚ÄØ258.97 billion
Gifts	                Tens of billions (growing)    USD 75.16‚ÄØbillion
Vehicles          	Not detailed	              Auto industry > $100B, ~7‚Äì8% GDP

That's the result for the whole industry 

So lets take a example as a nieche
Gift 

As i thought to grow ScantaQR let's talk about it 

In india yearly gift industry as per 2024 is 75.16 billion USD 
that is 6,597,999,518,000 inr 
Means 6.5 lakh crores are spended for the topic gift in india in 2024
If we take 35% as profit and 65% as production cost
then 35% of 6.5 lakh crores are 
2,309,299,831,300 inr 
That's 2.3 Lakh crores 

Thus we get to know in india where we don't need any visa to travel 
we can get the audience with the population of 1.45 billion +

and let's think as a visionary person as a business man

That my nieche is gift and yearly 2.3 lakh crores are being earned by this nieche in india 
So what is the average daily profit in india of this neiche 
2.3 lakh crores/365
6,326,848,852
that's  632 crores as average 
make it 600 then think daily 600 crores are being earned by this nieche 
and make a small target lets talk about 0.1% 

Draw the india map 
Divide it into 1000 areas like 1/1000
then you will get to know there are around 700+ districts only in india 
so if we divide india in 1000 parts and target the only one part as an average 
then see 0.1% = 1 of the 1000 parts = 60 lakhs earning per day in india.....

So i wrote a content in my book it's name is 
Archery 500

So in this it is like you need to target the 0.1% of the industry which is absolute possible even 1% too possible 
but if we are just targeting 0.1% we we are getting 60 lakhs 

so this is the daily profit in this nieche 
the Archery 500 is based on targeting the 0.1% of your nieche for 500 attempts

Imagine targeting a thing daily for 500 days = 500 attempts just for the 0.1% does it impossible??

101% it is poosible even with the more % 
Just we have to study on the nieche know what's the actual demand 
know what is being sold, go with the trend 

give 100% best in every attempt of 500 
Then it will be successfull and return a huge amount 

And if we do this as a job mind set 
Let's think if we even earn 50k per month it will takes 120 month to earn that much amount
which is around 3600 days 
Means 10 years

So the question is whyy people don't think like this 

1 They think they actually do but when they try to understand they get the burden of family responsibilities 
that's why they hesistate to take risks and all 

2 They don't write on there thoughts they believe they are just a normal and average guy that leads there mind to think small

üéØ <span class="section-title">The Four Pillars of Success (Duniya & Akhirah)</span>
1. Physical ‚Äî Strong, energetic, healthy body.
2. Mental ‚Äî Awareness, wisdom, clarity.
3. Islamical ‚Äî Soul connection, purpose, deen.
4. Financial ‚Äî Power, independence, impact.

as i mentioned you before we handle 2 dimention things 
1. Physical body
2. Spiritual body 

1 is made my the sand from the earth the other is made by the noor from the other dimention
so we have to feed both with there needs

the one who made up with sand will always seek hungry for the things that are actually made by sand 
the other which is made up with noor [soul] will always hunger for noor things

that means one is being satisfied with duniya pleasure like food, person, luxury, power etc
the other is being satisfied with the spiritual things like Quran, namaaz, sadqa, Roza etc

üöÄ <span class="section-title">The Challenge: 1 Year on Arkonox (750 Days)</span>
Let's see how to start on this 
Just remember every things can't be done over night 
good things takes time 

So here comes the transformation challenge from my book "1 Year on Arkonox"

Basically the story is

In the ancient time there was a planet name as arkonox which have 26 moons that leads to 26 months of the planet and the rotation of the 
planet was 780 days 30 days in each month 
but one day due to the astroids crash the tiny phase of the planet Arkonox has being divided from it along with a moon [the 26th moon]
So the moon names:

Arvion
Bravion
crystalis
Drazel
Elarin
Feyrix
Gavrix
Hyvora
ilmora
jureon
Kairith
lumivale
mavros
nythra
orlune
pyxen
Quelora
Raviel
Sylarin
tzareth
Ulrion
virellon
wyrix
xarnix
Yalara 
Zelune 

So the divided part has come closer to the sun and perform as a new planet along with the 26th moon - Zelune
That's why the peoples of the Arkonox calls that planet as Zem as it's the planet of the moon Zelune 

and in today's world zem is known as Earth and Zelune is knows as it's moon

So apart from this the planet Arkonox also come closer to the sun that leads it to rotate the whole sun in 750 days 
and with the 25 moon 
that's why every moon refers to a month of 30 days 

This planet is the planet of Knights 
Knight - a person who is success in that 4 elements, training, winning, getting powerfull day by day etc

The planet Arkonox 
Months = 25 
Total days = 750 
Total days per  month = 30 
Total weeks = phase = 6
Total days per week or phase = 5 

Week have 5 days they are:

1. Revnox - Reflection & Resilience
2. Alenox - Action & Alignment	
3. Imanox - Faith & Integrity	
4. Zenox  - Zen & Emotions	
5. Orinox - Opportunity & Outcome	

Thus we have to track every single day in this challenge with small changes and that will give huge return

Every days of the week have same tasks
tasks changes when week finished
it changes as a little bit that can actually be done


So how to track this 
Make a note book or note pad 

make page as Day 1 which is Arvion I Revnox 
Arvion [month] I [phase] Revnox [day]
Right earth date day too if needed 

so make coulumn as 

Physical              Mental                   Islamical             Financial
Workout [ ]           Meditation [ ]           Fajar [ ]             think of a idea [ ]
Food on time [ ]      Talk with parents [ ]    Zohar [ ]             save 10 ruppess [ ]

like this 

give challenges of every element for 0.1 point for 1 task 
daily 10 challenges for all the 4 elements 
0.1*10=1 
every element max points are 1 and total all elements = 4

So every end of month you have to set a target like total max points would be 120 
so if you are below 100 you get a punishment by all elements

like 
phyical = increase the workout for next month
Mental = Be socialize with people or low screen time 
Islamical = Nafiz namaaz tahjjud more, charity etc
Financial = cut some amount of self use and save it for savings


so set all the limits challenges as you need but train your body let it feel tired depressed etc 
but train train train 
believe me after the whole challenge 750 days you will be so proud of yourself and you will be soo independent 

So this planet is the main thing to be transformation even in early wars the kings who get defeated travel magically to the Arkonox

and train 1 year as a unstopable and become the more power full and dominating than before
and the 1 year of the planet Arkonox is 750 Days

So i copied it from ChatGPT but you get it what i mean so take daily 10 tasks as 0.1 points per elements
And set the tasks as you need or from the upper table but try to do all of that  

so for 750 days every day 4 points that means 3000 points 
so try to score 2500+ points and inn sha Allah the bright side will come soon

üèπ <span class="section-title">Train Like a Knight of Arkonox</span>
A Knight = someone who has mastered the 4 elements.
They return to their world stronger, wiser, and undefeatable.

This challenge will make you independent, powerful, and purpose-driven.

Remember Tassu, not everything happens overnight. 
Good things take time. But with effort, you will shine.

You are powerful. And I believe in you.

As Allah Knows the Best 

You know i remember every second i spend with you

and after the dark days we can enjoy the bright days 
with blessings prayers enjoyment etc 
but till that we have to be strong to survive this dark one to see
